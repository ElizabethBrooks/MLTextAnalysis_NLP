There is always that one person, that changed everything. Who made you realize love hurts. That no matter how much you would love to forget
<HANDLE> I'm saying I feel like I barely talk to you even though we talk everyday
I'm trying to go home ...
“<HANDLE>: I feel I'm standing in the middle of a crowded room, screaming at the top of my lungs, and no one even looks up.”
I feel like i havent had human contact in a while
My literal fucking heart hurts 
Can't believe she just died
How close could you be with someone you constantly talk shit about? #JustSaying #ImChilling
<HANDLE> no offense! I'm just tired of all that nonsense. Too close to home.
Todays just overall been a terrible day

Goodbye Arlington, MA 
“<HANDLE>: Sucks putting so much effort into that one person  getting nothing in return .”
I wish I had a girlfriend like Lilly
A walk around the campus paying tribute and showing support to all those affected by the tragedy… 
I have a lot of pride for where I live,  often gloat about it. Today Im sickened by what happened. Please remember to tell people you care.

Diversity is a good thing but when everyone shits on your race it's hard to appreciate it.
<HANDLE> <HANDLE> <HANDLE> :/
I can only hold onto hope for so long until I completely lose it all again
“<HANDLE>: an 8 year old ran to raise money for others and got killed while doing it, RIP #prayforboston 
"It's crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest"
Still sick to my stomach #prayforboston
I miss those butterflies when you talk to someone #longgone
We are the victims of ourselves
