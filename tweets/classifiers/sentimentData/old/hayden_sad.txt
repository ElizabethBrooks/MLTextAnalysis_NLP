I can't even try to be happy about life today, I feel horrible about what's going on with my city and all these families affected.
<HANDLE> all of this is just horrible. My sisters friend's aunt got her leg amputated today

I wish I was in Boston raging with <HANDLE> but at least we'll be raging to Nelly soon enough.
"<HANDLE>: I feel like everybody has met <HANDLE> except for me. Wow." I feel your pain :/
Fucking with heartless niggas gets to you after a while

Though I'm fine and otherwise not affected by the bombing, I will say the outpouring of concern and support from across the country...
Listening to 98.5 and hearing the explosion. Literally made me cringe i can not believe this
Its crazy how quick things change
Living that sick life.
<HANDLE> I agree.. but if you keep recycling your friends you'll never built a deep connection with anybody #storyofmylife

False hope
