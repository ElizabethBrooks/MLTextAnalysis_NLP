#RIP to the victims of the #bostonmarathon bombing like this 8 year old boy who's holding a poster \u2026 
I've seen so many runners with their medals with the most depressed faces. So sad to see that glory they should be feeling taken from them.
Is Lexington on lock down?
Watertown police: 20-block search is complete. Unfortunately we didn't have any success.

Father says dead suspect was a true angel and uncle says he was a loser. Awkward.
