Shots fired again? Squad cars hauling ass down mt auburn and mem drive
Hope everyone at the marathon is okay #praying
If this shit gets violent
There's something they're not NOT_telling NOT_us NOT_..
media being moved back another block after loud boom was heard!
Pls RT What I witnessed at yesterday's #BostonMarathon #OneBoston #PrayforBoston 
<HANDLE> so freaky. It's nerve-wracking.
Can't NOT_stop NOT_shaking NOT_..
I hate nightmares .. Woke up in a cold sweat  \U0001f623 \U0001f61e \U0001f62d
<HANDLE> I heard it was a suicide bombing
So hard for me to believe all this
This is seriously way too close to home
This is bizarre. These terrorists lived about 1.5 miles away from me
Second guessing 
Why's everyone mad at me though...?
Can't NOT_get NOT_it NOT_out NOT_of NOT_my NOT_head. Never want to see Boston the way I did yesterday ever again.
They bomb the marathon then rob a 7-11 after their faces are all over the news? Something isn't NOT_right..
ONE OF THE GUYS THAT PUT THE BOMB IN THE BOSTON MARATHON IS IN MY C
Sketchy.
